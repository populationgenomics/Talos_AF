# Talos AF (Actionable Findings)

This is a tool which is conceptually similar to [Talos](https://github.com/populationgenomics/talos), but is designed to specifically target the ACMG Actionable Findings variant list. 

This is designed to run on large callsets, and identify all instances of ACMG reportable variants, based on the flow chart *here*.
